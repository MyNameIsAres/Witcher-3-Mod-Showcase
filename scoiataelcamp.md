## Scoia'tael exploration marker

This mod was created with Radish tools and was my first project outside of the trials. It replaces an existing bandit camp in White Orchard.

By default they are entirely friendly and simply go about their normal day until you loot their chest. Then they become hostile towards you and will follow you up to a certain point.

From a technical point of view this project features:
- NPCs with custom loot
- NPCs with their own schedule and actionpoints
- NPCs with a follow range
