## A Gwent champion challenged!

Created a custom scene where Triss challenges Geralt to a round of Gwent. The goal of this project was to understand how to create scenes using the Radish tools with different camera angles, dialog choices, and apply amimations during the dialog. The player can choose to accept or deny the challenge and depending on the outcome of the game, or accepting/denying the challenge, different dialog will play. 

From a technical point of view this project features:
- Created a custom scene with different camera angles and dialog choices
- Attached animations to the scene script in Radish
- Attach different dialog paths depending on the player accepting or denying the challenge, winning or losing the match
- Play Gwent with an NPC
