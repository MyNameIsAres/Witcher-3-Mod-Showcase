## Better Beggars
Better Beggars is a project that aims to make beggars in The Witcher 3 more interesting to interact with and introduce a new mechanic where you can pay beggars. The outcome of giving money to a beggar can be different. They may reject it, accept it and offer you intel on hidden loot around the world, provide you with quests, or try to rob you. 

This video showcases an in progress mechanic to give beggars money.
