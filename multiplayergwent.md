## Multiplayer Gwent
Multiplayer Gwent is a project that has been in progress for some time now. In its current stage you can let exec functions in the game place cards for the player and even for the Ai. The goal is to eventually create a feature in the project WitcherHub that allows viewers on Twitch to play Gwent with a streamer. 

This mod was technically challenging as I had to edit .swf files using JPEXS. And because I had to edit a lot of Actionscript this meant I had to edit a lot of P-code, which is a pain. The result however was great. Being able to quickly showcase disabling the Ai entirely, placing cards on behalf of the Ai, changing the cards of the Ai, and placing cards for the player. 

This progress very much in progress still.
