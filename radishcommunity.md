## Communities with Radish

Created a new community in The Witcher 3 with characters and actions inspired by my friends. The goal of this project was to learn and understand how to create custom communities with their own schedule and trigger them to do something. In this case when I move to an area next to the house the NPCs all follow.

From a technical point of view this project features:
- Setup trigger areas for community NPCs to modify their actions
- Setup actionpoints with custom jobs and actions depending on the time of day
- Moved the painting job and animation over to female characters as this was previously only exclusive to male characters
